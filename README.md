Those who design the future are the ones who answer questions the average
person would never think to ask. Today, the future is here:

<h2>Why is the Internet so boring?</h2>
While most of us are content looking at pictures of cats and food, the rest
of us not only require richer content but a deeper experience altogether. It's
taken too long, but thankfully we've discovered the salvation of the World
Wide Web before it was too late. Gamification. With proven success in corporate
systems, social media, and even entertainment, gamification is the future.


<h2>How do you gamify the Internet?</h2>
It's deceptively simple, and the entire system is kept in a convenient little
Chrome extension! When users first use the extension, they begin their journey
towards better web surfing. Starting at the lowest rank, the user is able to
gain experience from basic actions ranging from navigation to content creation.
The amount of effort and calculated usefulness of the action corresponds to the
amount of experience gained. How can we tell if an action is beneficial to the
online community? We have finely tuned algorithmsâ„¢ that handle all the number
crunching!

Gamification of the entire Internet will take some time, so we've kept this
project open source to ensure the highest quality product for our users. Over
time the functionality and performance will no doubt improve, so it's all
uphill from here.

<h2>Embrace the future! Gamify the future! Become the future!</h2>
